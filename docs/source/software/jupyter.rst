Overview
=========
The `Jupyter Enterprise Gateway`_ is a multi-user environment for Jupyter Notebooks. DeepThought has integrated 
the Jupyter Gateway to allow users to run jobs on the cluster via the native Web Interface.  

If you have access to the HPC, you automatically have access to the Jupyter Lab. You can the JupyterLab Instance 
via the following `Jupyter URL`_ or manually via https://deepweb.flinders.edu.au/jupyter. Your credentials are the
the same as the HPC, your FAN and password.

If you are a student with access to the HPC, the above URLs may work - the URL http://deepteachweb.flinders.edu.au/jupyter is guaranteed to work correctly.
