Software Suites on DeepThought
===============================
DeepThought has several enterprise grade software suites either installed or under active development.  
These integrations run the gamut from Jupyter Notebooks for quality of life, to desktop integrations to the 
wider university software ecosystem.  This page give a brief overview on what integrations or suites are installed 
and their associated access requirements. 

More software will be added here as development and testing are finished.
