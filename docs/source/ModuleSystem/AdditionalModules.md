### EasyBuild Modules

You can opt-in to [EasyBuild](https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) Managed modules - these are the ones with the strict versioning of all aspects of the install. A brief warning and the list of modules is available [here](EasyBuildModules.md).

### Spack Modules

You can also opt-int to the experimental [Spack](https://spack.io/) modules. These modules are here for testing, but you are free to use them at your own risk! We are running tests to see how we can allow you more power to 'get on with it' and install you own software - Spack is a contender for one of the tools we may use. The list and another warning is over [here](SpackModules.md)
