# Unix / Linux Access

Unix and Linux systems have native support for the SSH Protocol, used to connect to the HPC.

## The Windows Sub-System for Linux

The windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows you to run a Linux Distribution as a sub-system in windows. When follwoing these instructions, a 'terminal' is the same as starting your WSL Distribution.

## Getting Connected

The simplest manner is to open up a terminal window and type in the following, substituting FAN for your FAN as needed.

- ssh FAN@deepthought.flinders.edu.au

If all is OK it will ask for your password. Enter the same password you use to login to OKTA.

## Success

Upon a sucessful login, you should get a screen similar to this:

If so, you are now connected and ready to start using the HPC!
